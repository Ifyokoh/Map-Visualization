# Map-Visualization
This is my contribution to the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team as part of the idea to create a new map visualization webs page for showing buildings, roads, and POIs collected in field programs from the HOT community.

As part of my contributions I think there is need to add icons specifying locations, amenities etc in areas. This is a single page app showing specific data from OSM which is the list of schools from a particular location which can easily be identified with a particular type of icon. 

The Geojson points can be incorporated to create a layer of points on a map and the map visualization was created with the help of MapboxGL.

# Steps 
- Initialize a map in an HTML element with Mapbox GL.
- Add an icon to the map from an external URL and use it in a symbol layer.
- Extract OpenStreetMap data.
- Visualize the data in the map.
